We have created an end-to-end website which will generate and show insights using the data
provided by the twitch api and provide insights and leaderboards on various topics on the live
streaming website
With the help of Streamlit, Twitch API, MongoDB along with Python and various python libraries,
we have been able to make a web application in which we are providing leaderboards and metrics
for people who might be interested in twitch.
